# FBikeInput

An application to process the output of the Ultrasport F-Bike excercise bike signal.

You can unplug the included bike computer cable (a mono 3.5inch audio jack) and line it into your computer.
This program will process the input as you cycle, and currently... outputs it to the console.

Visualisation / mapping / maybe VR coming soon.

# Usage

dotnet build
dotnet run
